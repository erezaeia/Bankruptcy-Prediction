# Bankruptcy-Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project was developed as part of the **Machine Learning** course to build and evaluate predictive models for **company bankruptcy prediction**.  
The primary objective is to leverage financial and operational data to classify whether a company is likely to go bankrupt, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Preprocess and explore real-world bankruptcy datasets.
- Handle **imbalanced data** using resampling techniques.
- Apply **feature selection** to improve model performance.
- Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models.
- Compare performance metrics across different algorithms.
- Interpret results to gain insights into financial risk factors.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** Provided by course instructors / publicly available bankruptcy datasets.
- **Features:** Financial ratios, operational indicators, and performance metrics.
- **Target Variable:**  
  - `1` → Bankrupt  
  - `0` → Not bankrupt
- **Challenge:** Highly imbalanced dataset (few bankrupt cases).

## 🛠️ Methods & Techniques
### **Data Preprocessing**
- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Scaling and normalization.
- Oversampling & undersampling (SMOTE, Random Undersampling).

### **Feature Selection**
- Correlation analysis.
- Mutual information.
- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).

### **Models Implemented**
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost / LightGBM)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

### **Model Evaluation Metrics**
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC Score
- Confusion Matrix
